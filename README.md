# 2023 Toronto Mayoral By-Election

## Overview

This project analyzes voter data from the 2023 Toronto Mayoral By-Election, focusing on the distribution of votes across Toronto's 25 wards. The goal is to understand how different regions within the city favored the major candidates, including Olivia Chow and Ana Bail√£o, the former becoming the Mayor of Toronto.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from opendatatoronto.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## Statement on LLM usage

The ideas for which demographic factors may influence voting patterns were determined with the help of ChatGPT. This was used to help me narrow down where in the regional census data I should examine. The prompt can be found in other/llm/usage.txt.
